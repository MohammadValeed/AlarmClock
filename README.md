# Alarm Clock Python Script

## Overview

This Python script is a simple alarm clock application that allows users to set alarms and be notified when the specified alarm time is reached. It plays a sound file when the alarm time matches the current time.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `playsound` library, which can be installed using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install playsound
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python alarm_clock.py`.

2. You will be prompted to enter the following information:

   - Enter Hour: [Specify the hour of the alarm]
   - Enter Minutes: [Specify the minutes of the alarm]
   - am / pm: [Specify whether it's AM or PM]

3. If you specify "pm" for the alarm time, the script will automatically convert it to a 24-hour format.

4. The script will enter a loop and continuously check the current time.

5. When the alarm time is reached, it will play the sound file "ringtone-126505.mp3" to notify you.

6. The script will then exit.

## Important Notes

- Make sure the "ringtone-126505.mp3" file is in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the audio file.

- Be cautious when running the script, as it uses an infinite loop to check the time, which may consume system resources. Consider adding a delay using `time.sleep()` to reduce resource consumption, as demonstrated in the code.

- The script does not provide any user interface or persistent alarms; it's a basic example to demonstrate alarm functionality.

## Future Improvements

This script can be improved in several ways:

- Add a user-friendly interface.
- Allow users to set and manage multiple alarms.
- Save alarm settings to a file for persistent alarms.
- Support different audio formats for the alarm sound.
- Consider creating a standalone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
